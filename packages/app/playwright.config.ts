 * Per-worker server isolation: there is no `webServer` block — instead a

 * Playwright worker spawns its own `pnpm run dev` process with a unique
 * tmpdir, eliminating the cross-worker CPU contention that created a
 * structural flake class under shared webServer.
 *
 * Per-test `baseURL` comes from the `baseURL` fixture in `fixtures.ts`, which
 * reads the worker's `workerServer.baseURL`. Consumers use
 * `test('...', async ({ page, api, baseURL }) => ...)` — no
 * `process.env.VITE_PORT` lookup required.

/**
 * Single-browser (Chromium). Most E2E tests use programmatic clipboard
 * injection via `dispatchEvent(new ClipboardEvent(...))`, not real browser
 * clipboard APIs, so cross-browser clipboard differences (Safari
 * user-activation rules, Firefox async clipboard restrictions) aren't
 * exercised. The one exception is the FR8 clipboard-denial case in
 * link-authoring-apex.e2e.ts, which runs a fresh context with clipboard-read
 * withheld to assert the real permission gate degrades silently — it needs no
 * cross-browser matrix either (the denial path is host-agnostic). Running 3×
 * browsers adds ~10 minutes of CI time with zero additional coverage.
 *
 * If future tests exercise REAL browser clipboard reads/writes that DO vary by
 * engine, add per-file project scoping for those tests only — not a global 3×
 * multiplier.

 * calibrated for the stock topology it ships with — many browser-only workers
 * sharing one `webServer` —

 * miss its budget, which is why the failures were always timeouts on an
 * arbitrary test and never assertion mismatches.
