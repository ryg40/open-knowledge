/**
 * Lingui i18n configuration for the OpenKnowledge editor frontend.
 *
 * `pseudo` is a generated pseudolocalization locale — `lingui extract` derives
 * it from `en` with no translation step. Loading a development build with
 * `?lang=pseudo` activates it (`src/lib/dev-pseudo-locale.ts`), which visually
 * marks every wrapped string so unwrapped (still-hardcoded) copy is obvious
 * during the rolling string-migration. It is not a supported language: it never
 * reaches the config enum or the picker, and a shipped build neither answers to
 * the parameter nor carries the catalog.
 *
 * Compiled catalogs (`messages.json`) are committed alongside the `.po` sources
 * so the same import path resolves under Vite dev, the production build, the
 * Electron renderer, and the test runtime without a per-entrypoint compile
 * step.
 *
 * `locales` is `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` from `@inkeep/open-knowledge-core` plus the
 * generated `pseudo`. It is spelled out literally rather than imported: the
 * Lingui CLI loads this file through its own TS loader, before any workspace
 * build, so a cross-package import would make catalog extraction depend on
 * core's build output. `tests/meta/supported-locales-sync.test.ts` pins the two
 * lists equal instead — a config value with no catalog behind it is a user
 * choosing a language and getting English.
