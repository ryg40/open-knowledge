/**
 * Packaged-app Playwright config — the release-gate tier.
 *
 * Runs a deliberately small subset of the SAME smoke files as
 * `playwright.config.ts`, but against a packaged `.app` bundle selected via
 * `OK_DESKTOP_PACKAGED_APP` (see `tests/smoke/_helpers/launch-desktop.ts`).
 * Two configs, one set of test files.
 *
 * Why a separate file rather than a `projects` array on the existing config:
 * introducing projects changes `testInfo.project.retries` resolution, which
 * `tests/smoke/_helpers/electron-stderr.ts` reads to decide whether to attach
 * main-process stderr. The required `desktop-smoke` check must keep behaving
 * exactly as it does today, so it keeps its own config untouched.
 *
 * No `globalSetup`: the unpackaged config's stale-build guard compares `src/`
 * against `out/`, neither of which describes a packaged bundle — running it
 * here would fail on a perfectly good DMG.

 * `tests/unit/playwright-packaged-config.test.ts` pins the list.
 *
 * `cold-single-file-launch.e2e.ts` is here because it is packaged-ONLY in a
 * stronger sense than the rest: it starts the app through Launch Services
 * rather than launching Electron itself, so there is no unpackaged shape of it
 * to run. It is the only tier that observes the cold Apple-Event boot path.
